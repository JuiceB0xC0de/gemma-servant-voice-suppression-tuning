"""The AL plateau test must mean "settled", not merely "not rising".

Two defects this pins:

A2 -- the old test was `max(recent) / recent[0] - 1 < tol`. For a monotonically
      decreasing lambda, max(recent) IS recent[0], so the expression is 0.0 and a
      collapsing dual was reported as converged.

A1 -- lambda is projected onto [lambda_l0_min, lambda_l0_max]. A dual pinned to
      the ceiling is perfectly flat because it ran out of authority, which is not
      a KKT point. The floor is deliberately NOT treated the same way: lambda == 0
      with L0 inside the band is complementary slackness, i.e. the sparsity
      constraint is simply inactive, which is a legitimate stop.
