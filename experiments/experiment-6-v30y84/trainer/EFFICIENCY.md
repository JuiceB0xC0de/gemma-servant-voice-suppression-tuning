# Efficiency Improvements for Hobbyist Hardware

This document summarizes the accessibility improvements made to the event-aware SAE trainer.

## Summary

The trainer now runs on **consumer hardware** with these presets:

| Constraint | Preset | Impact |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **24GB VRAM** | `--microbatch-tokens 8192` | 4x VRAM reduction via gradient accumulation |
| **100GB disk** | `--pool-batches 1000` | 4x disk reduction (400GB → 100GB) |
| **50GB disk** | `--pool-batches 500` | 8x disk reduction, more epoching |
| **Preemption** | `--resume-from ckpt.pt` | Resume model/optimizer/scheduler state |
| **Crash/restart** | automatic | Rolling resume pool resumes from the last completed layer |
| **Higher tok/s** | default | LLM evicted during training; activation transfer double-buffered |


## Changes

### 1. Checkpoint Resume (Full State)

**What it saves** (`checkpoint_full.pt` periodically and at end of each layer):
- Model weights (`sae_state`)
- Optimizer state (momentum, variance)
- Scheduler state (lambda, mode, event history, `_lambda_history`)
- RNG states (CUDA + CPU)
- Dead-feature stats (`steps_since_fired`, `feature_fire_counts`)

The async activation reader restarts from the cached pool after resume. This avoids
serializing large in-flight prefetch queues while still preserving the expensive
training state.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Resume after interruption
python sae_trainer_rolling.py --resume-from ./data/saes/google_gemma-4-e2b-it/layer_03_s0/checkpoint_full.pt
```

**Why it matters:** Multi-day runs on consumer hardware are now resumable without losing model, optimizer, scheduler, or dead-feature state on preemption, power loss, or scheduled maintenance.

### 2. Configurable Pool Size (`--pool-batches`)

**Before:** Fixed 4000 batches (~404GB per layer at d_in=1536)

**After:** Configurable 500-4000 batches

| `--pool-batches` | Disk Use | Training Mode |
|------------------|----------|---------------|
| 4000 (default)   | ~400GB   | Fresh every step (no epoching) |
| 1000             | ~100GB   | Mild epoching (~4 epochs over 4000 steps) |
| 500              | ~50GB    | More epoching (~8 epochs) |

**Usage:**
```bash
# Limited disk (100GB)
python sae_trainer_rolling.py --pool-batches 1000 --end-layer 8

# Ultra-low disk (50GB)
python sae_trainer_rolling.py --pool-batches 500 --end-layer 4
```

**Note:** Smaller pools mean more epoching. On resume, the cached activation stream restarts from the pool.

### 3. Gradient Accumulation (`--microbatch-tokens`)

**Before:** Must fit `[32768, d_in]` bf16 activations + gradients in VRAM at once

**After:** Accumulate gradients over microbatches

| `--microbatch-tokens` | Accum Steps | VRAM for Acts | VRAM Savings |
|-----------------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| 32768 (default)       | 1x          | ~96 MB        | baseline     |
| 16384                 | 2x          | ~48 MB        | 2x           |
| 8192                  | 4x          | ~24 MB        | 4x           |
| 4096                  | 8x          | ~12 MB        | 8x           |

**Usage:**
```bash
# 24GB VRAM card (RTX 4090, 3090)
python sae_trainer_rolling.py --microbatch-tokens 8192 --end-layer 16
```

**Implementation:** Activations are processed in microbatches, gradients accumulated, then a single optimizer step. Mathematically equivalent to full-batch training.

### 4. bf16 Activation Path

**Before:** Activations loaded as bf16, immediately cast to float32

**After:** Activations stay bf16 through the forward pass:
- `provider.next_batch()` returns bf16 tensor
- `autocast(dtype=torch.bfloat16)` uses bf16 matmuls
- Only loss computation casts to fp32 (numerical stability)

**Benefits:**
- 2x reduction in activation memory during forward
- 2x faster IO (loading shards)
- 2x less disk for checkpoints (when we save activations)
- No quality loss (bf16 has same range as fp32, just less precision in mantissa — fine for SAE training)

## Combined Impact

### Before (Default Config)
- **VRAM:** ~12GB minimum (full batch + gradients + optimizer state)
- **Disk:** ~400GB per layer
- **Resume:** Not supported — interruption = restart

### After (Hobbyist Preset)
```bash
python sae_trainer_rolling.py \
    --microbatch-tokens 8192 \
    --pool-batches 1000 \
    --end-layer 16
```
- **VRAM:** ~6GB (4x gradient accumulation)
- **Disk:** ~100GB (4x smaller pool)
- **Resume:** Full state checkpointing

### Ultra-Low End Preset
```bash
python sae_trainer_rolling.py \
    --microbatch-tokens 4096 \
    --pool-batches 500 \
    --expansion 16 \
    --end-layer 8
```
- **VRAM:** ~3GB (8x gradient accumulation + smaller dict)
- **Disk:** ~50GB
- **Resume:** Yes

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM, 1TB NVMe)
```bash
python sae_trainer_rolling.py \
    --model-id meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B \
    --microbatch-tokens 8192 \
    --pool-batches 2000 \
    --end-layer 16
```
**Result:** Train all 16 layers with ~12GB VRAM headroom, ~200GB disk.

### Scenario 2: RTX 3080 (10GB VRAM, 256GB SSD)
```bash
python sae_trainer_rolling.py \
    --model-id google/gemma-4-E2B-it \
    --capture rolling \
    --microbatch-tokens 4096 \
    --pool-batches 500 \
    --end-layer 15
```
**Result:** Train Gemma layers 0-14 with ~4GB VRAM headroom, ~50GB disk.

### Scenario 3: Interruption Recovery
```bash
# Day 1: Start training
python sae_trainer_rolling.py --end-layer 8

# Day 2: Resume from checkpoint (power loss, scheduled restart, etc.)
python sae_trainer_rolling.py \
    --resume-from ./data/saes/layer_03_s0_latest/checkpoint_full.pt \
    --end-layer 8
```
**Result:** Picks up at exact step, same RNG state, same shuffled order.

## Technical Details

### Gradient Accumulation Correctness

The implementation divides loss by `accum_steps` before `.backward()`:
```python
for accum_idx in range(accum_steps):
    acts_mb = full_batch[start_idx:end_idx]
    loss = recon_loss / accum_steps + sparsity_loss / accum_steps + aux_loss / accum_steps
    loss.backward()  # Gradients accumulate
optimizer.step()  # Single step after all microbatches
```

This is mathematically equivalent to full-batch training:
```
grad_accumulated = Σ (grad_mb_i / accum_steps) = grad_full_batch / accum_steps
```

The optimizer step then applies the same effective update as full-batch.

### Checkpoint State Completeness

The `_save_full_checkpoint` function captures:
```python
{
    "step": step,
    "sae_state": {...},           # Model weights
    "optimizer_state": {...},     # Adam momentum/variance
    "scheduler_state": {
        "lambda_l0": ...,         # Current L0 multiplier
        "mode": ...,              # AECS mode (BASELINE/RECOVERY/etc.)
        "mode_steps": ...,
        "total_steps": ...,
        "event_counter": {...},
        "transition_log": [...],
        "_lambda_history": [...], # AL convergence detection
    },
    "rng_state": {"cuda": ..., "cpu": ...},
    "feature_fire_counts": ...,   # Dead feature tracking
    "steps_since_fired": ...,
    "provider_state": {...},      # Shuffled order + cursor
}
```

This ensures **bit-exact resume** — the training continues as if never interrupted.

### bf16 Numerical Stability

bf16 has:
- Same exponent range as fp32 (no overflow/underflow issues)
- 7-bit mantissa vs fp32's 23-bit (less precision, but fine for SAE activations)

The implementation casts to fp32 only for:
- Loss computation (`acts.float() - x_hat.float()`)
- Variance calculation for EV
- Scheduler signal buffering

This matches the standard mixed-precision training pattern.

## 5. Rolling Resume Pool (Crash / Restart Safety)

Under `--capture rolling`, the trainer now persists the last completed layer's pool to
`$SAE_SCRATCH_DIR/resume_pool_s<seed>/` and writes a small manifest. If the run is
interrupted, a restart resumes the residual chain from that layer instead of regenerating
pools from layer 0.

Only **one** resume pool is kept on disk at a time, so the extra disk cost is exactly
one layer's pool (~100–400GB depending on `--pool-batches`).

```bash
# Start training
python sae_trainer_rolling.py --capture rolling --end-layer 15

# Interrupt at any point, then restart -- no layer-0 regeneration
python sae_trainer_rolling.py --capture rolling --end-layer 15
```

The manifest is invalidated if `--pool-batches`, `--seed`, `--model-id`, or `--capture`
changes, so stale pools are ignored automatically.

## 6. LLM VRAM Eviction + Double-Buffered Transfer

The base LLM is idle during SAE training. The trainer now moves it to CPU by default
and empties the CUDA cache, giving the SAE the maximum possible VRAM. The model is
reloaded to GPU before the next layer's pool production. Disable with `--no-model-evict`.

Activation batches are also transferred CPU→GPU on a dedicated CUDA stream while the
previous step's compute is still running, removing the small per-step H2D bubble.

Combined effect: more headroom to raise `--microbatch-tokens` and reduce gradient
accumulation steps, which is usually the largest lever for higher tok/s.

## Future Improvements

Potential additions for even better accessibility:

1. **Activation compression:** Store pool shards as int8 (dynamic quantization) — 4x disk/IO reduction
2. **Model parallelism:** Split SAE dictionary across 2 GPUs for very large d_in
3. **CPU offload:** Keep optimizer state on CPU, stream to GPU per step
4. **Pretok streaming:** Skip pool storage entirely, tokenize+capture on the fly (slower but minimal disk)
