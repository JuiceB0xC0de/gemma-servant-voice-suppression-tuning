# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-27

Two control decisions were being made from signals that could not support them.
Both showed up on the same run (antares-350m L5, 4251 steps, which should have
stopped around 2000).

### Added
- **PIN feature-tail guard.** PIN freezes the dual on the premise that sparsity is
  locked and EV just needs time to catch up. That premise is void if the dictionary
  is shedding active features, because the EV gain is then being bought by killing
  the tail rather than by learning. The guard captures the ultra-active feature
  fraction on PIN entry and releases PIN back to DESCENT when it falls below
  `pin_ultra_release_frac` (default 0.70) of that baseline for `pin_ultra_patience`
  (default 2) consecutive windows.

  On the run that motivated it, ultra fell 31300 → 15497 over 2000 PIN steps with
  lambda frozen the whole way. `dead_pct` read 0.0% throughout: features go *rare*
  long before they go *silent*, so the existing dead-feature ceiling is a lagging
  indicator here and never fired.

  If the tail keeps collapsing after being handed back to the dual
  (`pin_ultra_max_releases`, default 2), the run stops instead of cycling — at that
  point more training is only trading features for EV, and the best-EV checkpoint
  is already on disk.

  Structurally this is the same premise check as the existing L0-escape release,
  and it sits next to it. Fail-open: schedulers called without an `ultra_frac`
  signal behave exactly as before.

- `pin_ultra_release_frac` and `pin_ultra_patience` are live-tunable.
- W&B: `train/explained_variance_smooth`, `features/ultra_active_frac`.

### Changed
- **Stop gates read a smoothed EV, not a single batch's.** Batch-to-batch EV spread
  is routinely ±0.08 — wider than the margins the gates compare against — so gating
  on a raw sample made each gate partly a coin flip. Observed directly: EV bounced
  0.779–0.939 between adjacent windows while the layer was, by every other measure,
  converged and stable.

  Two concrete failures this caused. The Aggressive-K stop needs its EV floor held
  for 500 steps, and the counter reset on every unlucky batch, so it never fired and
  the layer fell through to the much later AL-convergence path. And `best_ev`
  latched onto the single luckiest measurement, which both misreports the peak and
  makes the post-peak decline margin trip against a peak that never really existed.

  The gates now read a rolling **median** (`SAE_EV_SMOOTH`, default 5 samples).
  Median rather than mean because the failure being defended against is one outlier
  batch, which a mean passes through in proportion to its size. Below 3 samples the
  raw value is used, so early-run behavior is unchanged.

  Affects: Aggressive-K early stop, post-peak collapse guard, `best_ev` / best-state
  persistence, and the EV the scheduler sees (so `pin_ev_thresh` too). The raw value
  is still what gets printed and logged as `ev`; the smoothed one prints as `evs`.

- **`>> OBS` samples now count.** They were computing the same global-variance EV as
  the log line and throwing it away. Feeding them into the smoothing window roughly
  doubles the sample rate the gates see at no cost.

### Fixed
- **Gradient norm is a control signal, not a log value.** Since 7920d89 (2026-06-15)
  the trainer passed `grad_norm=0.0` on non-log steps, on the stated theory that it
  was "only needed for logging/W&B". The scheduler pushes it into a 50-deep window
  that `_detect_base_event()` reads on every step, so those zeros were false
  observations rather than skipped samples. At `LOG_EVERY=250` the window held at
  most one real reading and was all-zero for 200 of every 250 steps, the last-10
  mean sat under `plateau_grad_norm_thresh` (1e-4), and PLATEAU latched the mode
  machine out of BASELINE into EXPLORE (1.5x LR, 0.5x weight decay) for the rest of
  the run. `GRADIENT_SPIKE` was simultaneously dead: over 49 zeros and one reading
  `g`, the EMA gives mu = 0.03g and sigma = 0.168g, so the z-score is 5.77 for any
  `g` against a threshold of 10.

  Activation required passing `event_warmup_steps` (5000) plus ~10 steps for the
  last real reading to age out. Every accepted MiniCPM and Qwen layer stopped
  between 1501 and 4751 steps, so no shipped atlas layer was affected, but
  `N_STEPS` defaults to 15_000: the exposure was entirely in long runs, which are
  disproportionately the ones already failing to converge.

  Now read every step. Regression coverage in `tests/test_grad_norm_signal.py`,
  including a source guard, since this is a tempting optimisation that already
  shipped once. If it ever needs deferring again, teach the scheduler that `None`
  means "no observation" and rescale its window first: swapping `0.0` for `None`
  without changing cadence would turn a 50-step window into a 12,500-step one.

- **Removed two write-only loss accumulators.** `accum_sparsity_loss` and
  `accum_aux_loss` were initialised and accumulated but never read by the
  scheduler, the log line, or W&B. Their `.item()` calls cost a synchronous D2H
  copy per microbatch for values nothing consumed. `accum_recon_loss` and
  `accum_l0` stay: both feed control every step.

### Note
`best_ev` now tracks smoothed EV, so the persisted best state can lag the true peak
by up to half a window. That is deliberate: it beats persisting whatever weights
happened to coincide with a lucky measurement.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- **Killswitch keys on the existing `live_tune.json`.** Two levels, same file:

      {"stop": true}       ends the CURRENT layer cleanly at the next 50-step poll
                           -- normal early-stop path, so sae.pt and meta.json are
                           written and the layer pushes -- then the walk continues
      {"halt_run": true}   stops the whole walk before the next layer starts, and
                           prints the --layer-range needed to resume

  Both accept `"stop_reason"` for the log line. Fail-open by design: a missing,
  empty, unreadable or malformed file is a no-op, since a typo in a control file
  should not end eight hours of GPU time.

  This makes the file watchable — something reading `>> OBS` lines can decide "EV
  has been flat for 900 steps" and act on it with one line of JSON, alongside the
  `target_l0` / `ste_bandwidth` / `lambda_l0_override` knobs that were already there.

- `SAE_CONTROL_FILE` overrides the control-file path (default `/tmp/live_tune.json`).

### Changed
- **The container-local control file is now always polled.** Previously the whole
  live-tune mechanism was inert unless `live_tune_path` was set in config, so the
  documented `/tmp/live_tune.json` fallback never actually fired. It works with no
  setup now — but a stale `/tmp/live_tune.json` left on a pod will be picked up
  where it was previously ignored.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- **Activation pools are namespaced by model.** Pool directories were `pool_L00_s0`
  with no model in the name, while the token pool already carried one. Pointing the
  same `SAE_DATA_DIR` at a second model silently reused the first model's
  activations. It raised here only because `d_in` differed (2048 vs 1024) — **two
  models of the same width would have trained on the wrong stream with no error at
  all.** Now `pool_{model_slug}_L00_s0`. The rolling resume pool was already safe;
  its manifest checks `model_id`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-27

> Inert by default. With `SAE_SPARSE_DECODE=0` results are identical to 0.6.1.

### Added
- **Gathered decoder** (`_SparseDecode`), behind `SAE_SPARSE_DECODE`. The latent is
  ~0.1% dense (K=50 of F=65536), so the decoder forward and the decoder weight
  gradient are almost entirely multiplication by zero. Both become gathers:

      forward     embedding_bag over active indices     O(B*K*d)
      grad_W      chunked scatter-add, same indices     O(B*K*d)
      grad_acts   grad_out @ W_dec -- DENSE, unchanged  O(B*F*d)

  Two of the six equal-sized GEMMs in a step disappear.

  `grad_acts` stays dense deliberately. The threshold STE masks on
  `(pre - threshold).abs() < bandwidth`, a band spanning **both** sides of the
  threshold, and consumes `pre * grad_feat`. Features just below threshold are
  inactive, so a gathered gradient there would zero exactly the term that pulls the
  threshold down — and with `slack=0` (L0 under target) that is the only surviving
  term. Sparsifying it would silently break threshold adaptation, so this takes two
  GEMMs rather than three.

  Exact algebraically, **not bit-identical**: `index_add_` accumulates with atomics,
  so summation order varies for features firing on many tokens and bf16 will show
  it. CPU float64 tests hold to 1e-12; a GPU bf16 run will not.

  Falls back to dense when the active set is empty or exceeds `SAE_SPARSE_DECODE_KMAX`
  — never truncates, since dropping a live feature corrupts the reconstruction
  silently. Fallbacks are counted on the SAE so a high rate is visible.

  **Speed is unmeasured on GPU.** Baseline is 173ms `fwd_bwd_cuda` at d=2048,
  F=65536 on an H100 (254 TFLOP/s, 26% of peak). Two of the five remaining GEMMs is
  ~70ms of that if the gather overhead doesn't eat it. Measure before trusting.

- `SAE_SPARSE_DECODE`, `SAE_SPARSE_DECODE_KMAX`, `SAE_SPARSE_DECODE_CHUNK`.

### Changed
- Per-token active counts are reduced once and used twice — max for the decoder,
  mean for the sparsity term. `l0_mb` is unchanged and still in-graph.
- `decode()` takes an optional `active_max` so callers holding `gate` can skip a
  full `[B, F]` scan.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-27

> Not numerically identical to 0.5.0: the encoder backward changes accumulation
> order. The result is the same quantity by exact algebra, not the same bits.

### Added
- **Reassociated encoder pre-bias gradient** (`_EncoderPreBias`). A JumpReLU step
  is six GEMMs of `2*B*d*F`, all the same size. One of them exists only because
  `b_dec` needs a gradient: autograd forms the full `[B,F] x [F,d]` grad_input and
  then reduces it over the batch. The batch sum commutes with the right-multiply,

      d(loss)/d(b_dec) = -sum_b (dpre_b @ W_enc) = -(sum_b dpre_b) @ W_enc

  so the same value comes from an `[F]` reduction plus one GEMV. That removes ~1/6
  of the step's FLOPs. Exact, not an approximation.

  Falls back to plain autograd whenever `x` requires grad, so callers that need
  `grad_x` are unaffected. `SAE_FAST_PREBIAS=0` disables it outright.

  **Measured:** gradients match plain autograd to 1e-10 in float64 and the forward
  to 1e-12 (`tests/test_prebias_reassociation.py`). Encoder-only throughput on CPU
  improves 18% at `B=512,d=256,F=8192` and 24% at `B=1024,d=512,F=16384`, the
  trend rising with size as GEMMs come to dominate. **The full-step speedup on GPU
  is not yet measured** — the prediction is ~17%, i.e. `fwd_bwd_cuda` moving from
  123–125ms to roughly 103–108ms at CodVa's shape. Treat that as a hypothesis with
  a test attached, not a result.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-27

> Runs are **not numerically comparable to 0.4.0**: controller behaviour and the
> default early-stop thresholds both changed.

### Added
- **`rolling-generic` capture**: single-block rolling for custom architectures
  whose decoder blocks take `(x, cos, sin)` positionally, using
  `get_input_embeddings()` and a `_get_rope`-style helper. `auto` promotes to it
  automatically, but only after verifying the single-block walk reproduces the
  model's own forward on a probe batch — a wrong block signature would produce
  garbage activations silently rather than raise. `auto` previously ran a **full
  model forward per layer** on these models, i.e. O(n_layers²) block evaluations.
  Measured on CodVa-1-Small: 69.5k → 205k tok/s, max relative error 0.00e+00.
- **Capture timing breakdown**: per-layer read / forward / write split and a
  MoE-vs-dense label on the produce line.
- **`OBS` trace**: step 1 then every `SAE_OBS_EVERY` steps (default 100),
  reporting L0, EV, dead% and threshold, colour-coded. `LOG_EVERY` is
  deliberately untouched — it is the AL dual cadence and the dead/fire-rate
  window, not a print interval.
- **`--timing-every`** on both entry points; `[STEP-TIME]` now defaults to every
  25 steps instead of off.
- **`SAE_STOP_L0_REL` / `SAE_STOP_EV_FLOOR`**: the Aggressive-K stop thresholds
  are no longer literals.

### Changed
- **Threshold nudge is two-sided again.** The overshoot gate compared L0 and
  target against an absolute feature count tuned for `K=500`. At `K=50` both
  sides sat permanently under it, so the downward nudge never fired for an
  entire run while λ pushed down continuously — a one-sided pulse actuator
  against an integrator. The gate is now relative to target and behaves
  identically at either K.
- **Undershoot nudge scales with severity** instead of being capped at a flat
  gain, and escalates its frequency when far under target, mirroring the
  overshoot path.
- **Dual update has a recovery gain below target.** λ wound up at up to 24×
  through the slingshot and unwound at exactly 1×, so λ ratcheted upward across
  a run even with L0 centred on target (observed: 2.4e-3 → 6.9e-3 while L0 sat
  at 46–56).
- **Revived features get the live median threshold**, not `INIT_THRESHOLD`.
  0.1 is an absolute activation-scale constant: ~0.75σ on an early layer and
  ~0.03σ on a deep one, so revival injected a depth-dependent discrete L0 step
  that the controller had no visibility into.
- **Default early-stop EV floor 0.95 → 0.90.** EV declines with depth as the
  residual-stream norm grows, so a floor tuned on shallow layers blocked the
  stop on every deep one and burned the full step budget.
- **Config `env:` overrides the inherited shell**, matching the documented
  `CLI > config > defaults` precedence. Previously `setdefault` let a stale
  export beat an explicit config value.
- **Rolling chain resumes at `start_layer`** when its pool is already on disk
  instead of rebuilding from L0, and removes pools below the entry point that
  the retention loop can never reach.

### Fixed
- **`vocab_size` is read from the model config**, not `tokenizer.vocab_size`.
  The latter excludes added tokens, so every model with FIM / ChatML / domain
  tags failed the token-range check and refused to train.
- **HF credentials resolve from `hf auth login`** as well as `HF_TOKEN`; a
  CLI-only login no longer aborts a push-enabled run, and one call site could
  raise `KeyError` outright.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **Mid-chain bootstrap**: rolling runs can start at any layer without
  regenerating the pool chain from L0. Entry uses one hooked full-forward
  capture pass, and `activation_norm_ref` is restored from the previous
  layer's `meta.json` so the chain norm stays consistent. Warns and falls
  back to self-referencing if no reference is found — pass `--norm-ref`
  to pin it explicitly.
- **`pool_retention` / `--pool-retention`**: how many previous layers'
  pools stay on disk as rollback insulation.

### Changed
- Pool retention now defaults to **3** (was 1). Catching a bad layer late
  no longer means recomputing the whole chain — you can restart from L-3.
  Costs up to 2 additional pools of disk; lower it with
  `--pool-retention 1` if the volume is tight.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- **PIN stop gate**: the scheduler pins convergence once L0 holds inside the target
  band and stops the layer early; the pin is released if L0 escapes the band.
- **Hard 1% dead-feature ceiling** with rollback to the last clean window.
- **Per-dimension EV logging** alongside the scalar EV.
- **`--norm-ref` / activation-norm reference**: reuse a prior run's activation
  normalization when retraining, persisted with the resume pool.
- **`rolling-float` / `rolling-hf-float` capture modes**: hoist/drop blocks so only
  the active sandwich sits in VRAM.
- **`run_atlas.py` config-driven runner**: one YAML per model under `configs/`,
  CLI overrides on top; replaces the per-model runner scripts.
- **CI**: pytest suite runs on every push and pull request.
- **Streaming fallback** when pre-tokenized shards are absent.

### Fixed
- AuxK dead-set cache was being reset every step, neutering dead-feature revival.
- Streaming-tokenizer fallback could use the wrong model's tokenizer.
- `HF_SAE_REPO` env var handling was case-sensitive.
- Global `*.json` gitignore rule was swallowing `configs/`.
- `validate_floating_window` walks the pool chain contiguously for sparse layer
  lists and creates the token dir before shard capture.

### Removed
- Per-model and cloud-runner scripts; `run_atlas.py` + `configs/` is the single
  entry point above the trainer.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed
- **Pinned coherent dependency stack** for Gemma-4, Qwen3, and Qwen3.5 model families:
  `torch>=2.6.0,<2.8.0`, `transformers>=5.0.0`, `torchvision`, `torchaudio`,
  `accelerate>=1.6.0`, `datasets>=3.0.0`, `numpy<3.0.0`.
- **RunPod setup no longer inherits system-site packages**: `setup_runpod.sh` now
  creates an isolated venv and installs an ABI-matched CUDA 12.4 torch stack from the
  PyTorch index, preventing `undefined symbol` import crashes caused by the image's
  pre-installed torchaudio/torchvision wheels.

### Changed
- `setup_runpod.sh` accepts `MODEL_ID` env var and pre-caches that tokenizer instead
  of hardcoding `google/gemma-4-E2B-it`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Rolling resume pool persistence**: the last completed layer's activation pool is
  persisted on disk as a resume checkpoint. A restart resumes the residual chain from
  that layer instead of regenerating pools from layer 0. Exactly one resume pool is
  kept at a time.
- **LLM VRAM eviction during SAE training**: the base model is moved to CPU while the
  SAE trains (it is idle then), freeing GPU memory for larger microbatches / less
  gradient accumulation. Enabled by default; disable with `--no-model-evict`.
- **Double-buffered activation transfer**: H2D copies of the next activation batch
  now run on a dedicated CUDA stream and overlap with the current training step's
  forward/backward/optimizer work.
- **`--target-l0` CLI/runtime override**: override the global L0 target `K` (default
  500) without editing the source. Useful for aggressive sparsity tests (e.g. K=50).
- **`gemma4_sae_k50_test.py` Modal app**: clone the trainer from GitHub at image build
  time and run a small-scope K=50 test on Gemma-4 E2B.

### Changed
- **Auto capture is now truncated per layer**: instead of hooks + `_EarlyExit`, the
  decoder ModuleList is sliced to `[:layer+1]` for each layer's capture. Same
  correctness, less hook overhead, and the forward naturally stops after the target
  layer.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Self-tuning SAE trainer** with event-aware scheduler (AECS mode machine + Augmented-Lagrangian L0 integrator)
- **Model-agnostic activation capture** via forward hooks (works with any `AutoModelForCausalLM`)
- **Gemma-optimized rolling capture** for layers 0–14 (single-block walk, VRAM/compute efficient)
- **Comprehensive test suite** covering SAE architecture, scheduler, capture, datasets, and CLI
- **Validation script** (`validate_rolling_cache.py`) proving bit-exactness of rolling capture
- **Example usage script** (`examples/use_trained_sae.py`) for loading and inspecting trained SAEs
- **pip-installable package** via `pyproject.toml`
- MIT license and contribution guidelines

### Key Features
- Set an L0 target and walk away — each layer converges independently
- No per-layer hyperparameter retuning required
- Dead features held near-zero via aux-loss revival + threshold reset + resampling
- One command sweeps all decoder layers in a single unattended run
