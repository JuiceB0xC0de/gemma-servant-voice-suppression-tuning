"""
SAE-extended AECS -- Dual-Loop Adaptive Control for JumpReLU SAE Training.

AECS base (AECS-scheduler): LR scheduler via 4-mode state machine
    (BASELINE, RECOVERY, EXPLORE, STABILIZE) driven by gradient/loss dynamics.

SAE extension: LAMBDA_L0 as a second actuator, responding to:
    - L0 error: L0 vs target K (PI controller)
    - EV floor protection: EV drops -> pull LAMBDA back
    - Dead feature emergency: dead_pct > threshold -> STABILIZE
    - Early stop: EV stays above floor for N consecutive windows

Two control loops, one event detection engine.

    # -- Direct threshold nudge (bypasses STE gradient bottleneck) ------------
    # When L0 is far above target, the JumpReLU STE only gives gradient to
    # features whose pre-activations are near the threshold.  Features far
    # above threshold are "stuck on" — the gradient can't reach them.
    # The threshold nudge directly steps log_threshold based on L0 error,
    # bypassing the STE entirely.  This is a proportional controller:
    #   nudge = nudge_gain * (L0 - target) / L0
    # applied to log_threshold of ALL features (not just near-threshold ones).
    # Positive nudge pushes threshold up → fewer features fire → lower L0.
    #
    # The nudge is L0-proportional:
    #   - Gain scales with overshoot: nudge_gain * max(1, overshoot / approach_scale)
    #   - Frequency scales with overshoot: more frequent when L0 >> target
    #   - Symmetric undershoot dampener: when L0 < target, applies a gentle
    #     downward nudge to prevent overshoot from pulling threshold too high.
    #   - Dead band near target: suppress nudge within tolerance to avoid
    #     oscillation with the AL integrator.
    #
    # Interaction guard (Fable): bandwidth floor (0.15) ensures STE gradient
    # stays wide enough to provide a restoring force alongside the nudge.
    # The undershoot dampener provides symmetry — if L0 drops below target,
    # the nudge reverses to lower thresholds, preventing the nudge from
    # overshooting alone.
    threshold_nudge_gain: float = 0.08      # proportional gain (0 = disabled; 0.08 for E4B)

    threshold_nudge_deadband_rel: float = 0.10      # suppress nudge within +/-10% of target

    # -- W_enc gradient dampening -----------------------------------------------
    # When L0 >> target, W_enc weights adapt to keep features on despite rising
    # sparsity pressure — a classic SAE pathology where the encoder "inflates"
    # to overpower the threshold.  This dampens the W_enc gradient proportional
    # to L0 overshoot, reducing the encoder's ability to fight back while L0
    # converges.  Blunt but effective — revisit if recon degrades.

    # -- STE bandwidth (gradient channel width) ---------------------------------
    # Default 0.1 matches the JumpReLU paper. Widen (e.g. 0.2-0.3) to give
    # gradient signal to more features near threshold when L0 is stuck.
    # Live-tuneable: write {"ste_bandwidth": 0.3} to live_tune.json.
    ste_bandwidth: float = 0.2

    # -- L0-adaptive STE bandwidth -----------------------------------------------

    # that are "stuck on" (far above threshold).  As L0 approaches target,
    # narrow back toward the base.  Floor at ste_bandwidth_floor to prevent
    # the gradient channel from collapsing entirely.
    # Interaction guard (Fable): the bandwidth floor (0.15) prevents the
    # adaptive bandwidth from going so narrow that the threshold nudge (#2)
    # overshoots alone — the STE gradient channel stays wide enough to
    # provide a restoring force.

    # -- L0-aware lambda warmup --------------------------------------------------
    # In deep layers, L0 can start 4-8x above target. Starting lambda at 0 means
    # the AL integrator has to build up from zero, which wastes thousands of steps
    # while L0 runs away. Seed lambda proportional to the initial overshoot so
    # the integrator has a head start.
    # lambda_warmup = warmup_base + warmup_per_overshoot * max(0, initial_l0/target - 1)
    # Capped at lambda_l0_max. Set warmup_per_overshoot=0.0 to disable.

    lambda_warmup_per_overshoot: float = 5e-3   # lambda added per unit of overshoot ratio

    # -- Live-tune dials (runtime overrides via JSON file) --------------------

    #   lambda_l0_max, al_mu, al_dual_step, target_l0, lambda_l0_override,
    #   ste_bandwidth, threshold_nudge_gain

    #   PIN      — L0 in band; freeze sparsity pressure (lambda + threshold
    #              nudge) and let EV catch up.
    #   FINETUNE — release lambda gently to settle on the final equilibrium.
    # These knobs are config-only until the corresponding gates are wired in
    # later branches; the legacy ev_stop_thresh/ev_stop_patience above stay
    # authoritative for stopping until FINETUNE is implemented.
    pin_l0_band_abs: float = 0.5        # |L0 - target| <= this -> DESCENT enters PIN

    # "PIN would timeout ... [observe-only: no return to DESCENT yet]" and takes
    # no action -- the bail is staged but unwired. The knob's only live effect is
    # in _check_early_stop, where a timed-out PIN satisfies the stop gate that
