"""
Event-aware SAE trainer -- train one sparse autoencoder per decoder layer, unattended.
======================================================================================
THE POINT of this trainer is the event-aware scheduler (sae_scheduler.py): an AECS
mode controller plus an Augmented-Lagrangian L0 integrator that makes training
*self-tuning*. You set an L0 target; the scheduler overshoots it, then the dual
integrator pulls lambda back, L0 oscillates and converges as close to target as the
model allows, while dead features are held ~0 (aux-loss revival + threshold reset +
resampling + a dead-feature emergency mode). It sweeps every layer in a single run
with no per-layer hyperparameter retuning and no babysitting -- the failure mode that
forces restart-and-retune loops in fixed-schedule SAE trainers.

The scheduler and the training loop are MODEL-AGNOSTIC: they consume a stream of
activation batches from a provider and never touch model internals. How activations
are produced is pluggable (`--capture`):

  auto         (default) -- forward-hook the residual stream of any AutoModelForCausalLM.
                            Correct by construction (observes the real forward). Re-runs a
                            (truncated) forward per layer: 1 pool of disk, N x compute.
  rolling      (opt-in)  -- Gemma-3n/4 single-block walk. Gemma-specific invariants
                            (per-layer embeddings, sliding/full masks, KV sharing).
                            Guarded by validate_rolling_cache.py.
  rolling-float (opt-in) -- same walk as rolling, but the full model stays on CPU
                            and only the active block (+ pinned shared components)
                            is hoisted to GPU. Same math as rolling: identical
                            _produce_pool path, weights merely change device.
  rolling-hf   (opt-in)  -- generic Llama/SmolLM2/Qwen-style single-block walk using
                            the model's own rotary_emb and position_embeddings. Same
                            disk/compute win as rolling, but works for any HF decoder
                            whose layers accept position_embeddings.
